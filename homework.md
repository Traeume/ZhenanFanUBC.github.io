# Homework

## Collaboration policy

All homeworks involve programming tasks. You may collaborate and
consult with other students in the course, but you must hand in your
own assignments and your own code. If you have collaborated or
consulted with someone while working on your assignment, you must
acknowledge this explicitly in your submitted assignment. If you are
unsure about any of these rules, feel free to consult with your
instructor or visit the departmental webpage on
[Collaboration and Plagiarism](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/docs/collaboration-plagiarism).

## Late submissions

Each student has a three lecture-day delay allowance to use throughout
the term. A delay allows you to submit by the following class without
penalty; for example, if an assignment is due on Wednesday in class,
then submission by Friday counts as one delay, and by Monday counts as
two delays. Apart from using delays, late submissions are not
accepted. Once a solution set has been posted, no more late
submissions are permitted; consequently, you may not always be able to
use all of your delays.
